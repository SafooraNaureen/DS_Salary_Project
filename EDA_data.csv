2) provide on-demand analysis to support emergent operational needs; and, 3) develop performance dashboards and artifacts to inform resource allocation, justify requirements, and support statutory reporting mandates. in all three areas, data analysts must be capable of transforming large volumes of raw data, both structured and unstructured forms, into mission-focused insights that enhance understanding of mission performance, workload, and/or behavioral trends (i.e., strategic, tactical, and operational insights). analysts may be called upon to support a diverse array of initiatives involving complex queries in support of network analysis, entity resolution, threat research, visualization, and impact assessments.  the strongest applicants will engage in highly dynamic, threat/risk driven operating environments. they will bring a proven track record of working with decision support tools and applications operationally employed by mission-support entities. within three to six months of joining the project, we expect analysts will: master relevant data schemas, reference data, joining conditions, and relationships of existing databases, as well as associated warehouses and data marts, involving trade, travel, national security, and law enforcement data. conduct exploratory analysis demonstrating: a refined understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the underlying data; a willingness to explore non-traditional data sources and evaluation methods; and a clear link to mission need. construct query code as well as run, save, edit, optimize, and document queries using sql and other languages including spark to extract mission-critical insights. design, develop and deliver analytic artifacts such as dashboards, scorecards, and structured excel reports that: support executive-level, at-a-glance findings; empower non-technical users to explore user-specific equities (e.g. powerbi); and/or provide detailed information informing operational outcomes. assess validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity of data as well as develop mitigation steps and processes to address data quality issues in support of clean data. translate findings (e.g. mission impacts, limitations of findings/ analytical confidence, analytical methods and techniques employed) to clearly articulate the “so what” within the context of mission performance to technical and non-technical audiences in the form of written reports and in-person briefings. engage internal and external stakeholders in a professional and informed manner to collect analysis requirements and ensure alignment of expected outcomes. integrate with, and materially contribute to, portfolio teams as a matrixed resource to provide data analytics expertise in support of modeling, ad hoc query support, or performance assessment initiatives in collaboration with data scientists, intelligence analysts, developers, and other participants under the direction of a project manager. applicants should note that while some formal training exists to support building knowledge of missions and the implementation of data-driven solutions, but much of the knowledge must be gained through on-the-job training and individual initiative. technical knowledge is insufficient to achieve effectiveness in this operating environment;

using our capital, expertise, and influence to create markets and opportunities in developing countries. in fiscal year 2019, we invested more than $19 billion in private companies and financial institutions in developing countries, leveraging the power of the private sector to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. for more information, visit www.ifc.org  ifc’s infrastructure and natural resources (inr) department  industries that can harness natural resources are vital for many of the world’s poorest countries. the ifc’s inr department provides finance and advice for private sector clients and help governments adopt effective regulations and strengthen their capacity to manage these industries across the value chain. the sustainable infrastructure advisory (sia) team, within inr department, supports companies to ensure that local communities enjoy concrete benefits from projects, focusing on transparency, supply chains, jobs, environmental stewardship, and community engagement.  natural resources play a dominant role in social, economic, environmental and political aspects in at least 81 countries. collectively these nations account for a quarter of the world’s gdp and half of the world’s population. unfortunately, the abundance of natural resources does not always translate into widespread wealth distribution or growth, and can even exacerbate inequalities, conflict, and corruption. the promotion of good governance is therefore a key part of the development agenda and has risen in importance for government, private sector, and civil society alike.  the overarching goal of the “from disclosure to development” (d2d) program is to enhance the effectiveness of disclosures in support of achieving clear development outcomes from investments in natural resources. it is led by ifc and is implemented in collaboration with the world bank. the program builds on the world bank’s experience in assisting governments and civil society with open data, eiti implementation, digital government and development data innovation programs, as well as on the ifc’s extensive work to guide private and public institutions to share benefits of investments in natural resources with local communities. implementation of phase 2 of the program is planned for 2020-23.  the d2d team is looking to expand its advisory services with data-driven approaches to

2) provide on-demand analysis to support emergent operational needs; and, 3) develop performance dashboards and artifacts to inform resource allocation, justify requirements, and support statutory reporting mandates. in all three areas, data analysts must be capable of transforming large volumes of raw data, both structured and unstructured forms, into mission-focused insights that enhance understanding of mission performance, workload, and/or behavioral trends (i.e., strategic, tactical, and operational insights). analysts may be called upon to support a diverse array of initiatives involving complex queries in support of network analysis, entity resolution, threat research, visualization, and impact assessments.  the strongest applicants will engage in highly dynamic, threat/risk driven operating environments. they will bring a proven track record of working with decision support tools and applications operationally employed by mission-support entities. within three to six months of joining the project, we expect analysts will: master relevant data schemas, reference data, joining conditions, and relationships of existing databases, as well as associated warehouses and data marts, involving trade, travel, national security, and law enforcement data. conduct exploratory analysis demonstrating: a refined understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the underlying data; a willingness to explore non-traditional data sources and evaluation methods; and a clear link to mission need. construct query code as well as run, save, edit, optimize, and document queries using sql and other languages including spark to extract mission-critical insights. design, develop and deliver analytic artifacts such as dashboards, scorecards, and structured excel reports that: support executive-level, at-a-glance findings; empower non-technical users to explore user-specific equities (e.g. powerbi); and/or provide detailed information informing operational outcomes. assess validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity of data as well as develop mitigation steps and processes to address data quality issues in support of clean data. translate findings (e.g. mission impacts, limitations of findings/ analytical confidence, analytical methods and techniques employed) to clearly articulate the “so what” within the context of mission performance to technical and non-technical audiences in the form of written reports and in-person briefings. engage internal and external stakeholders in a professional and informed manner to collect analysis requirements and ensure alignment of expected outcomes. integrate with, and materially contribute to, portfolio teams as a matrixed resource to provide data analytics expertise in support of modeling, ad hoc query support, or performance assessment initiatives in collaboration with data scientists, intelligence analysts, developers, and other participants under the direction of a project manager. applicants should note that while some formal training exists to support building knowledge of missions and the implementation of data-driven solutions, but much of the knowledge must be gained through on-the-job training and individual initiative. technical knowledge is insufficient to achieve effectiveness in this operating environment; expertise must be enhanced with rapid acquisition of mission knowledge and demonstrated commitment positive mission outcomes. therefore, we seek self-starters who are capable of independent exploration and knowledge acquisition, willing to develop informal support networks, and with an appreciation for the immense challenge of safeguarding the nation’s borders.  bs degree in a related technical fields (computer science, math, statistics, etc.) hands on experience working with data-mining, analysis or statistical software such as r, matlab, sas enterprise miner, spss modeler, or sql developer for data analysis hands on experience with at least one of the following technologies: hadoop eco system, including hdfs, yarn, cassandra, hive, pig, and spark hands on experience with batch-oriented and streaming distributed processing methods such as nifi, spark, kafka, or storm hands on experience with distributed search engines like elasticsearch or solr conceptual understanding of – and/or prior experiences related to – data profiling, fuzzy matching, entity resolution, and signal detection theory (specifically with respect to sd theory: designing and improving upon systems that monitor, minimize, and balance false positive and false negative outcomes) completed cbp background investigation clearance (active or re-instate-able)  experience with programming languages such as java, python, and sql unix / linux experience experience working in field of entity resolution, analytics, data mining or name matching. delivering solutions using amazon web services (e.g., aws ec2, rds, s3) experience with javascript frameworks like angular, react and jquery is a plus experience with visualization tools and techniques (e.g., periscope, business objects, d3, ggplot, tableau, sas visual analytics, powerbi)  e3/sentinel is an equal opportunity employer and vietnam era veterans readjustment assistance act (vevraa) federal contractor. all qualified applicants receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, protected veteran status, or status as a qualified individual with a disability. e3/sentinel hires and promotes individuals solely on the basis of their qualifications for the job to be filled.",4.4,"E3 Federal Solutions

2) provide on-demand analysis to support emergent operational needs; and, 3) develop performance dashboards and artifacts to inform resource allocation, justify requirements, and support statutory reporting mandates. in all three areas, data analysts must be capable of transforming large volumes of raw data, both structured and unstructured forms, into mission-focused insights that enhance understanding of mission performance, workload, and/or behavioral trends (i.e., strategic, tactical, and operational insights). analysts may be called upon to support a diverse array of initiatives involving complex queries in support of network analysis, entity resolution, threat research, visualization, and impact assessments.  the strongest applicants will engage in highly dynamic, threat/risk driven operating environments. they will bring a proven track record of working with decision support tools and applications operationally employed by mission-support entities. within three to six months of joining the project, we expect analysts will: master relevant data schemas, reference data, joining conditions, and relationships of existing databases, as well as associated warehouses and data marts, involving trade, travel, national security, and law enforcement data. conduct exploratory analysis demonstrating: a refined understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the underlying data; a willingness to explore non-traditional data sources and evaluation methods; and a clear link to mission need. construct query code as well as run, save, edit, optimize, and document queries using sql and other languages including spark to extract mission-critical insights. design, develop and deliver analytic artifacts such as dashboards, scorecards, and structured excel reports that: support executive-level, at-a-glance findings; empower non-technical users to explore user-specific equities (e.g. powerbi); and/or provide detailed information informing operational outcomes. assess validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity of data as well as develop mitigation steps and processes to address data quality issues in support of clean data. translate findings (e.g. mission impacts, limitations of findings/ analytical confidence, analytical methods and techniques employed) to clearly articulate the “so what” within the context of mission performance to technical and non-technical audiences in the form of written reports and in-person briefings. engage internal and external stakeholders in a professional and informed manner to collect analysis requirements and ensure alignment of expected outcomes. integrate with, and materially contribute to, portfolio teams as a matrixed resource to provide data analytics expertise in support of modeling, ad hoc query support, or performance assessment initiatives in collaboration with data scientists, intelligence analysts, developers, and other participants under the direction of a project manager. applicants should note that while some formal training exists to support building knowledge of missions and the implementation of data-driven solutions, but much of the knowledge must be gained through on-the-job training and individual initiative. technical knowledge is insufficient to achieve effectiveness in this operating environment;

2) provide on-demand analysis to support emergent operational needs; and, 3) develop performance dashboards and artifacts to inform resource allocation, justify requirements, and support statutory reporting mandates. in all three areas, data analysts must be capable of transforming large volumes of raw data, both structured and unstructured forms, into mission-focused insights that enhance understanding of mission performance, workload, and/or behavioral trends (i.e., strategic, tactical, and operational insights). analysts may be called upon to support a diverse array of initiatives involving complex queries in support of network analysis, entity resolution, threat research, visualization, and impact assessments.  the strongest applicants will engage in highly dynamic, threat/risk driven operating environments. they will bring a proven track record of working with decision support tools and applications operationally employed by mission-support entities. within three to six months of joining the project, we expect analysts will: master relevant data schemas, reference data, joining conditions, and relationships of existing databases, as well as associated warehouses and data marts, involving trade, travel, national security, and law enforcement data. conduct exploratory analysis demonstrating: a refined understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the underlying data; a willingness to explore non-traditional data sources and evaluation methods; and a clear link to mission need. construct query code as well as run, save, edit, optimize, and document queries using sql and other languages including spark to extract mission-critical insights. design, develop and deliver analytic artifacts such as dashboards, scorecards, and structured excel reports that: support executive-level, at-a-glance findings; empower non-technical users to explore user-specific equities (e.g. powerbi); and/or provide detailed information informing operational outcomes. assess validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity of data as well as develop mitigation steps and processes to address data quality issues in support of clean data. translate findings (e.g. mission impacts, limitations of findings/ analytical confidence, analytical methods and techniques employed) to clearly articulate the “so what” within the context of mission performance to technical and non-technical audiences in the form of written reports and in-person briefings. engage internal and external stakeholders in a professional and informed manner to collect analysis requirements and ensure alignment of expected outcomes. integrate with, and materially contribute to, portfolio teams as a matrixed resource to provide data analytics expertise in support of modeling, ad hoc query support, or performance assessment initiatives in collaboration with data scientists, intelligence analysts, developers, and other participants under the direction of a project manager. applicants should note that while some formal training exists to support building knowledge of missions and the implementation of data-driven solutions, but much of the knowledge must be gained through on-the-job training and individual initiative. technical knowledge is insufficient to achieve effectiveness in this operating environment;
